## Development

This project is built based on the [FAV0](https://github.com/Justin3go/FAV0) template, using the VitePress framework.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Freelander/AI-Daily.git
cd AI-Daily

npm i -g pnpm # If necessary
pnpm i
pnpm docs:dev
```

**Directory Description:**

Mainly look at the files in the `docs` folder.

- `.vitepress`: All configurations of the website are in this folder.
  - `dist`: The output location of all resources generated by the website, also the target location for deployment.
  - `config`: Configurations related to the website's title, description, icon, language, navigation, tracking code, etc.
  - `theme`: Configurations related to the website's theme, page styles, and functional components (Giscus comments, appreciation), etc.
  - `utils`: Configurations related to the website's sidebar, RSS, metadata, etc.
- `assets/fonts`: The font packages used by the website.
- `posts/**` and `en/posts/**`: The files in this folder are your own output content.

If you need to carry out secondary development, it is recommended to have some understanding of VitePress first. Detailed documentation is [here](https://vitepress.dev/zh/).
