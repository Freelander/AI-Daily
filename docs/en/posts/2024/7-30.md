### Cutting-edge News

**1. Shengshu Technology released the end-to-end text-to-video large model Vidu.**

Based on the U-ViT architecture, it can generate up to 16 seconds of 1080p HD video at one time, featuring high consistency, multi-camera generation, strong coherence, and rich imagination.

Detailed introduction: https://www.shengshu-ai.com/vidu

Online experience: https://www.vidu.studio/create

Currently, you can log in directly using a Google account and get 80 points for experience. Each use consumes 4 points and generates a video of up to 4 seconds.

I tried it out, the generation speed is fast, the video is stable, and the content matches the description quite well. However, ordinary users can only generate 4s videos, so it's not possible to test the coherence of long videos.

Personally tested it with a Xiaomi car SU7 image. First, fill in the background prompt, then fill in the product prompts (texture, lighting, style), and finally control the fusion intensity according to the situation.
