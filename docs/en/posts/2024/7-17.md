**2. Alibaba releases the latest audio language model Qwen-Audio.**

It can accept various audio signal inputs and respond with audio analysis and direct text according to voice commands. It offers two different audio interaction modes:

- Voice chat: Allows free voice interaction with Qwen2-Audio without text input.
- Audio analysis: Allows providing audio and text instructions for audio analysis during interaction.

Currently, only the paper is released, but the model download and online experience will be available soon.

### Open-source Projects

**1. A local model adaptation open-source project based on GraphRAG: GraphRAG-Ollama-UI.**

Adapts Microsoft's GraphRAG locally, integrates with Ollama, and provides a visual interactive interface.

Supports file management such as upload, edit, and delete, real-time visual knowledge graph, supports using local models, and offers one-click deployment with Docker.
