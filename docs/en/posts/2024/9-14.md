**1. Alibaba’s audio-to-video project EchoMimic now has a ComfyUI plugin.**

You only need to provide a character image and audio to generate a realistic and lip-synced character portrait animation video. Additionally, with adjustable markers, the animation can be made more vivid and natural.

### Open Source Projects

**1. An automated tool for clipping exciting parts of long videos and generating short videos: AI YouTube Shorts Generator.**

The main function is to extract interesting and engaging clips from long videos, then edit, add background music, generate titles and descriptions, and finally produce new short videos.

GitHub: https://github.com/SamurAIGPT/AI-Youtube-Shorts-Generator

Workflow:

1. Video download: Given a YouTube video link, the tool automatically downloads the video;
2. Transcription: Uses Whisper to transcribe the video content;
3. Highlight extraction: Utilizes GPT-4 to identify the most engaging parts of the video;
4. Speaker detection: Detects speakers in the video;
5. Vertical clipping: Clips the highlights into vertical videos and creates short videos.

Personally, I think this is quite suitable for automating the clipping of speeches by celebrities. If you're interested, feel free to explore it.
