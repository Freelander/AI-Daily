**2. AI music generation tool Udio released the latest model Udio v1.5.**

Compared with the v1 model, it has many improvements, including higher audio quality, enhanced key pitch control, and added multilingual support.

In addition to updating the model, some practical features of the Udio platform have also been updated, such as exclusive creation pages, downloading music clips, audio-to-audio mixing features, and sharing music lyrics.

### Cutting-edge Technology

**1. An end-to-end speech dialogue model SpeechGPT2, similar to GPT-4o!**

It can perceive and express emotions and provide various styles of voice responses such as rap, drama, robot, funny, and whisper based on context and human instructions.

Detailed introduction: https://0nutation.github.io/SpeechGPT2.github.io/

This is already the second version, currently only a demo video is provided, and the effect looks good with timely and rich emotional responses.

**2. Meta AI open-sourced an intelligent agent task system llama-agentic-system specially built for Llama.**

It allows you to run Llama 3.1 as a system with the ability to execute complex tasks and use built-in and learning tools.

GitHub: https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-agentic-system

For example, executing the following "agent" tasks:

- Decomposing tasks and performing multi-step reasoning.

- Ability to use tools:

  - Built-in tools: The model has built-in tool knowledge, such as search or code interpreter.

  - Zero-shot learning: The model can learn to use tools defined in contexts it has not seen before.

Additionally, input and output security filtering can be provided through Llama Guard to address use cases requiring different levels of security protection.

### Learning Books

**1. An illustrated note on the book "The-Art-of-Linear-Algebra".**

Visualizes the important concepts of matrices introduced in the book to help everyone understand vector, matrix calculations, and algorithms from the perspective of matrix decomposition. Provides notes in Chinese, English, and Japanese.

GitHub: https://github.com/kenjihiranabe/The-Art-of-Linear-Algebra

The book "Linear Algebra for Everyone" is written by a mathematics professor Gilbert Strang from MIT.

The professor adopts a step-by-step teaching method, from simple concepts to core concepts of linear algebra, including basic operations of vectors and matrices, linear equations and their solutions, vector spaces and subspaces, etc., explained in plain language.

Students interested in linear algebra can check it out.

### Open-source Projects

**1. Share a LaTeX-based resume framework Render on GitHub.**

It comes with multiple themes and can be used to create high-quality resumes. Supports generating PDF, LaTeX, Markdown, HTML, and PNG format documents from YAML input files.

GitHub: https://github.com/sinaatalay/rendercv

Additionally, it provides a series of tools for automating the resume update process, such as rebuilding LaTeX files, rendering new PDF files, and automatically converting each page to PNG images.
