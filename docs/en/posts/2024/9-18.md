### Cutting-edge News

**1. Doubao Team Releases Music Generation Framework: Seed-Music, Comparable to Suno!**

In addition to supporting song generation from lyrics, converting lyrics to sheet music and then to songs, and song editing, there are two additional highlights:

1. It supports cloning the timbre of the original song and generating a new song, directly productizing the previously popular AI Stefanie Sun project.
2. It supports fine-grained style control, allowing the melody to remain unchanged while only modifying the lyrics.

Currently, no public trial is available, only a few demo presentations have been released. From what I‚Äôve seen, it seems to be even stronger than Suno!

**2. OpenAI increases the usage limit of the o1 model.**

On the 17th, it announced that for Plus and Team users, the usage of the o1 Preview model will increase from 30 times/week to 50 times/week, while the o1 mini model usage will increase from 50 times/week to 50 times/day.

**3. Luma AI launches AI Video API.**

It becomes the first publicly available API for AI video products. Before, companies like KooLing also launched API functions, but it required special application.

### Cutting-edge Technology

**1. A technology framework for image editing via dragging: InstantDrag.**

Directly drag the parts and directions you want to modify in the image, no need for input prompts, and the generated effect appears within 1 second for interactive image editing.

### AI Drawing

**1. A unified image generation model: OmniGen.**

Aims to solve multiple image generation tasks with one model, achieving drawing condition control without the need for additional models like ControlNet or IPAdapter.
