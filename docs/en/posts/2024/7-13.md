### Learning Tutorials

**1. GraphRAG Manifesto: Adding Knowledge to GenAI.**

A few days ago, Microsoft open-sourced a powerful RAG architecture, GraphRAG. If you do not understand it well, I recommend reading this article, "GraphRAG Manifesto: Adding Knowledge to GenAI."

It provides a simple and clear introduction to the principles of GraphRAG, the differences from traditional RAG, the advantages of GraphRAG, the creation of knowledge graphs, and how to work with knowledge graphs.
