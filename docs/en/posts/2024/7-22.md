### AI Painting

**1. Easily achieve image stylization transfer with B-LoRA.**

You can separate style and content of images to achieve high-quality mixing and adjustment of style and content, as well as exchange style and content between two stylized images.

Trained B-LoRAs can be used as independent components for various image stylization tasks, including image style transfer, text-based image stylization, consistent style generation, etc.

**2. Tencent's PhotoMaker has been updated to the second version, with better fidelity and controllability!**

No need to train LoRA, just upload a few photos of a person to generate multiple styles of realistic human images.

Compared to v1, v2 has higher fidelity and supports the use of T2I-Adapter to improve controllability of the images.
