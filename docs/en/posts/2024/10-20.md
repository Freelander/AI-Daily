### Cutting-edge Technology

**1. Meta open-sources a new multimodal language model: Spirit LM.**

Based on the Llama2 model, it extends to support speech modality through continuous training on text and speech, supporting both text and speech input and output.

GitHub: https://github.com/facebookresearch/spiritlm

Detailed introduction: https://speechbot.github.io/spiritlm/

Two versions are provided: Base and Expressive, with the Expressive version showing good performance in pitch and style.

**2. Adobe's research on generating 3D scenes from multiple images: Long-LRM.**

By inputting 32 scene images, this technology uses 3D Gaussian reconstruction to restore the entire 3D scene in just 1.3 seconds.

Detailed introduction: https://arthurhero.github.io/projects/llrm/

From the demonstration provided, the effect looks good, but fast generation requires high-performance configurations.
