**2. A French AI lab Kyutai will open-source a model comparable to GPT-4o called Moshi.**

Moshi, like GPT-4o, is a real-time multimodal model that can listen, speak, and see, and can be interrupted at any time.

From the demo, it appears slightly inferior to GPT-4o but is very close.

Kyutai official website: https://kyutai.org/

Online experience: https://moshi.chat/?queue_id=talktomoshi

Tried it out, currently unusable, possibly due to high user volume. Interested parties can try it. Looking forward to the open-source release.

### Open-source Projects

**1. Found a meaningful open-source project on GitHub: "Meet Li Bai".**

The project aims to promote and popularize Li Bai's poetry culture by building an AI agent with a Li Bai knowledge graph in a generative dialogue application.

GitHub: https://github.com/BinNong/meet-libai

The ultimate goal is to develop a generative dialogue application to interact with you in real-time, providing a personalized Li Bai poetry appreciation experience.
