### Cutting-edge News

The scenario and product demonstration at Zhipu's release event were reminiscent of OpenAI, and the on-site demo of the video feature (benchmarking GPT-4oâ€™s advanced voice capabilities) looked quite impressive.

However, it is not yet fully open for use and requires an application to join.
