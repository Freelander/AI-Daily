**2. The first diffusion transformer model for generating open-world video game content: GameGen-O.**

It can automatically generate high-quality open-world game content, such as multiple characters, environments, and actions, supporting interactive control capabilities with structured instruction prompts, operation signals, and video prompts.

More details: https://gamegen-o.github.io/

It can be used to create open-world game content similar to GTA or Zelda.

### Open-source Projects

**1. An open-source, lightweight, and fully functional prompt tool: ell.**

Open-sourced by OpenAI research scientist William, designed for better management and optimization of AI model prompts.

GitHub: https://github.com/MadcowD/ell

Key features include:

- **Prompts as Programs**: William believes that prompts are not just simple text but should be controlled and managed like programs;
- **Prompts as Model Parameters**: It provides a wealth of tools for optimizing prompts, supporting automatic version control and serialization, as well as auto-generated commit messages;
- **Monitoring, Version Control, and Visualization Tools**: Built-in `Ell Studio` tool for version control, monitoring, and visualizing prompts;
- **Multimodal Support**: Supports handling of various data types such as text, images, audio, and video, making multimodal prompt engineering as easy as processing text.
