Built on the AutoGen framework, with Orchestrator as the main agent responsible for task decomposition, planning, progress tracking, and error recovery, while guiding other specialized agents to complete specific tasks.

This enables solving complex multi-step tasks, such as operating web browsers, browsing local files, or writing and running code.
