### Learning Tutorials

**1. A comprehensive free learning course on large language models (LLM).**

Through the best practices of LLMOps, from data collection to deployment, this course teaches us how to build a production-level LLM and LLM-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system.

GitHub: https://github.com/decodingml/llm-twin-course

The course mainly consists of 11 lessons, covering system design, data engineering, feature pipeline, training pipeline, and inference pipeline.

Learn from hands-on experience how to collect and store data, prepare data for LLM fine-tuning and RAG, and how to deploy and monitor LLM and RAG systems.

All the code involved in the practice can be found in the GitHub repository. For those who are preparing to learn how to build LLM and RAG systems, this is worth checking out.
