**1. Concept Sliders: An adapter for precise control of image generation attributes.**

This tool allows you to adjust specific attributes of an image, such as the age of a person, the width of their smile, hair length, eye size, and more using sliders.

Currently, it is compatible with SD and Flux image models. However, the Flux adaptation is still in the experimental phase, and only a demo for SD is available.
