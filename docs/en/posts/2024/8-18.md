**2. An open-source tool based on LLM for OCR-scanned PDFs: LLM-Aided.**

It aims to transform raw OCR-scanned PDF text into highly accurate, well-formatted, and easy-to-read Markdown documents by leveraging multimodal large language models (LLM).

GitHub: [https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/llm_aided_ocr](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/llm_aided_ocr)

Features include:

- PDF to Image: Uses pdf2image to convert PDFs into images, supporting specific page ranges.
- OCR Processing: Uses Tesseract for OCR processing, extracting text from images.
- Efficient Error Correction: OCR errors are corrected through LLM, which can use local LLM or APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic).
- Smart Text Chunking: Splits the full text into more manageable chunks while preserving natural sentence boundaries.
- Markdown Formatting: Converts the text into standard Markdown format.
- Quality Evaluation: Uses LLM to compare original OCR text and processed output, providing quality scores and explanations.

**3. An automation tool based on GitHub Action: Product Hunt Daily Chinese Hotlist.**

It automatically crawls and generates Markdown files of the top products on Product Hunt daily, helping everyone quickly view the daily Product Hunt hotlist.

GitHub: [https://github.com/ViggoZ/producthunt-daily-hot](https://github.com/ViggoZ/producthunt-daily-hot)

Features include:

- **Automatic Data Retrieval**: Automatically retrieves the top 30 products from Product Hunt every day.
- **Keyword Generation**: Generates simple and easy-to-understand Chinese keywords to help users better understand the product content.
- **High-Quality Translation**: Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model for high-quality translation of product descriptions.
- **Markdown File Generation**: Generates Markdown files containing product data, keywords, and translated descriptions, making it easy to post on websites or other platforms.
- **Daily Automation**: Automatically generates and submits daily Markdown files through GitHub Actions.
- **Configurable Workflow**: Supports manual triggers or scheduled content generation via GitHub Actions.
- **Flexible Customization**: The script is easy to extend or modify, allowing for the inclusion of additional product details or adjustments to the file format.
