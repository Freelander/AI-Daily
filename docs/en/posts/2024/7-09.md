### AI Painting

**1. An ultra-high-resolution image generation model: UltraPixel.**

Supports generating ultra-high-resolution images (1k to 6k) directly while maintaining image generation efficiency.

Detailed introduction: https://jingjingrenabc.github.io/

From the demo images, it retains a lot of details, such as hair strands and the roots of plants.

The model is not yet open-source, so keep an eye out for updates.
