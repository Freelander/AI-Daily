### Cutting-edge Technology

**1. AnchorCrafter: A tool for generating realistic and interactive e-commerce product videos.**

By simply providing a person's image + product image + pose action video, it can generate realistic product videos showing people introducing products.

Detailed introduction: https://cangcz.github.io/Anchor-Crafter/

The demonstration video shows excellent results, with natural and realistic interaction between people and objects, looking just like real people introducing products.

Though the code is not yet open-sourced, it's worth keeping an eye on.

**2. TryOffDiff: A high-fidelity clothing reconstruction technology for virtual try-on.**

Different from previous virtual try-on approaches, this technology captures the shape, texture, and complex patterns of clothing worn in photos to convert them into standardized product images.

Detailed introduction: https://rizavelioglu.github.io/tryoffdiff/

Online demo: https://huggingface.co/spaces/rizavelioglu/tryoffdiff

It can be combined with previous virtual try-on technologies - first using TryOffDiff to extract clothing from a person, then placing it on another person.

Capable of converting text to natural speech at ultra-fast speeds, supporting voice cloning, with low memory usage and ability to handle multiple requests simultaneously.

GitHub: https://github.com/astramind-ai/Auralis

Supports multiple languages including English, Spanish, French, and Chinese, plus audio quality enhancement and noise reduction.

Official tests on a 3090 GPU showed it could complete the voice conversion of an entire "Harry Potter" novel in 10 minutes. Worth trying if you need such functionality.
