### Cutting-edge News

**1. Alibaba launched the Qwen2-Math model, now available for online experience!**

It supports both text and image-based queries, and its 72B parameter model outperforms GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 in mathematics capabilities according to benchmark tests.

I personally tested it by finding a function problem online, took a screenshot, and asked it. It provided a detailed explanation process, and the answer was correctâ€”indeed very powerful!

If you're interested, give it a try.

### Open Source Projects

**1. A fast-responding and fully localized AI voice chat tool: voicechat2.**

It uses WebSockets to achieve low-latency voice interaction and allows remote access, enabling local execution of any voice recognition, text-to-speech, and large language models.

GitHub: [https://github.com/lhl/voicechat2](https://github.com/lhl/voicechat2)

On a local 4090 GPU, it can achieve latency as low as 300 milliseconds, with very fast response speed!
