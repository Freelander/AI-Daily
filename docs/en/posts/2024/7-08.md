Here is the latest AI information for July 8.

### Cutting-edge Technology

**1. Discovered a new real-time object detector: RT-DETR.**

It is the first real-time end-to-end object detector that outperforms YOLO detectors of the same scale in terms of speed and accuracy.

### AI Painting

**1. ControlNet Plus model for image generation and editing.**

Based on the original ControlNet architecture, it supports more than 10 types of control in conditional text-generated images and can generate high-resolution images comparable to Midjourney.

### Open-source Projects

**1. Stanford's open-source Prompt programming framework: DSPy, currently with 14.1k stars.**

Features include:

- Modular programming: Provides standard modules to help you write prompts.
- Auto compiler: Automatically fine-tunes prompts and parameters for specific LLMs.
- Supports solving complex multi-hop retrieval similar to HippoRAG.
- Supports powerful mainstream large models like GPT-4o, Claude 3, Gemin Pro, Llama, etc.

**2. Implemented real-time audio and video call capability of GPT-4o's launch with 160 lines of code.**

Using OpenCV for video capture, GPT-4o for text processing and multimodality, and Whisper and TTS for audio processing.

The code is already open-sourced on GitHub, and the author has recorded a tutorial video. Those interested can take a look.
