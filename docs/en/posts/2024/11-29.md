### Cutting-edge Technology

**1. A video generation model maintaining character consistency: ConsisID.**

Only requires one reference portrait photo to generate high-quality videos through text while maintaining character consistency.

**2. Google releases a video decomposition technology: Generative Omnimatte.**

Can decompose input videos into a series of RGBA layers with transparency, each layer containing a complete object, which can be either objects or characters.
