### Cutting-edge Technology

**1. Another photo editing artifact that can modify image attributes at will.**

A new image editing technology called Alchemist, launched by the Google team. It uses diffusion models to achieve precise control of material properties of objects in real images, including roughness, metalness, reflectance, and transparency.

This is achieved by fine-tuning pre-trained text-to-image models on synthetic datasets to edit real images.
