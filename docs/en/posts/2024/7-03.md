Spend 1 minute every day to get the latest AI information.

The content includes but is not limited to **cutting-edge AI news**, **AI tools**, **AI painting**, **open-source projects**, and **learning tutorials**.

The main feature of the brief is its concise description, but important information is still introduced in detail through independent posts.

Here is the latest AI information for July 3.

### Cutting-edge News

**1. Meta AI has launched a new, leading, and fast text-to-3D asset generation process: Meta 3D Gen.**

It can create high-quality 3D models and textures in less than a minute, supporting physically-based rendering and exceeding industry benchmarks in visual quality and prompt fidelity under complex text prompts.

### Cutting-edge Technology

**1. Powerful RAG technology is here! Microsoft has open-sourced GraphRAG.**

Unlike traditional RAG methods, it provides significant QA performance improvements by using knowledge graphs, establishing community hierarchies, generating community summaries, and leveraging these structures when performing RAG tasks.

### AI Tools

**1. Another open-source TTS model discovered: Fish Speech.**

Trained for 300,000 hours, it is proficient in Chinese, Japanese, and English, with rich voice performance. The Chinese effect is particularly good, and it can handle mixed Chinese and English.
