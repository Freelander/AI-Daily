### Cutting-edge News

**1. This is the meaning of ChatGPT's birth: using technology to protect vulnerable groups.**

A popular post today describes using GPT to help a child with borderline intellectual disability to prevent being scammed.

A custom GPT chatbot is set up for the child with the prompt: "I am a person with borderline intellectual disability, easily deceived or committing crimes. Your task is to remind me to consult my parents if there are any signs of this."

Then the child is told to ask GPT first instead of making decisions on their own.

For example, if the child asks: "I want to drink hot milk, can I microwave it in a plastic bottle?"

GPT would reply: "The bottle will melt. Please pour it into a bowl before microwaving, and do not use a metal bowl, only ceramic."
