Here is the latest AI information for July 5.

### AI Painting

**1. More efficient image control model ControlNeXt.**

Supports control of images and videos, and compared to ControlNext, it reduces up to 90% of training parameters, achieving faster convergence and excellent efficiency.

It can also be directly combined with other LoRA technologies to change styles and ensure stable generation.

### Learning Books

**1. An open-source book on GitHub: "Python Guide for JavaScript Engineers".**

The author is a former front-end engineer who, influenced by artificial intelligence, decided to systematically learn Python and compiled this book from the learning process.

It covers all aspects from Python environment installation to project development, and compares the similarities and differences between JavaScript and Python through examples, helping JavaScript engineers quickly master Python.
