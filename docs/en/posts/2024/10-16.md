### Cutting-edge Technology

**1. Is an open-source version of HeyGen coming?**

The TANGO project can generate full-body conversational videos matching corresponding audio by providing an audio clip and a reference video of body movements.

From the generated videos, the lip sync with the audio is not very accurate. It might be better to combine it with some open-source lip-sync projects, such as Kuaishou's LivePortrait.

**2. Bringing image characters to life: Animate-X.**

Similar to AnimateAnyone, by inputting a character image + reference action, it can animate the character according to the specified action, maintaining good character consistency.

Detailed introduction: https://lucaria-academy.github.io/Animate-X/

It performs well with various character types including real people, game characters, cartoons, and animations.

### AI Drawing

**1. An efficient and accurate technique for image inversion and editing: Rectified Flows (RFs).**

It can generate images in a similar style based on reference images, and also supports editing images based on text descriptions, such as adding glasses to a person or changing a person's age and gender.

Detailed introduction: https://rf-inversion.github.io/

From the demonstration images provided, the effect looks quite impressive, but the project code has not yet been open-sourced.

### Open Source Projects

**1. An open-source intelligent speech-to-subtitle text tool: AsrTools.**

It integrates official interfaces from Jianying, Kuaishou, and Bijian, supports flac, m4a, mp3, wav audio formats, efficient batch processing, and can generate .srt and .txt subtitle files.

GitHub: https://github.com/WEIFENG2333/AsrTools

It provides a simple and easy-to-use interface, requiring no GPU or complicated local configuration, making it easy for beginners to use.
