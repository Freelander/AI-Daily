### Cutting-edge Technology

**1. A tool that can generate animated 3D models from single-character hand-drawn images: DrawingSpinUp.**

No training required; it can be used directly to transform a single hand-drawn character into a high-quality 3D animation while maintaining the style and details of the drawing.

Detailed introduction: https://lordliang.github.io/DrawingSpinUp/

GitHub: https://github.com/LordLiang/DrawingSpinUp

The code is open-source and deployable. This technology allows children's hand-drawn pictures to come to life, which is very fun.
