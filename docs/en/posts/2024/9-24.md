### Cutting-edge News

**1. ByteDance releases two Doubao video generation models, the demo looks impressive!**

The models are PixelDance and Seaweed, with PixelDance being more advanced, both based on the DiT architecture.

They can achieve complex continuous action generation for characters, as well as multi-shot combined videos, and even extreme control over camera movements.

Here are a few highlights:

- Supports smooth transition between multiple shots in a single prompt while maintaining consistency in theme, style, and atmosphere;
- Supports one-time generation of 10s complete story videos;
- Supports generation of various video styles, such as black and white, 3D animation, 2D animation, Chinese painting, etc.;
- Supports generation of various video ratios, including 1:1, 3:4, 4:3, 16:9, 9:16, 21:9 six ratios.
