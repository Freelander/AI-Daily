**üé≠ GaussianSpeech: Generate high-fidelity 3D character head animations from voice input, supporting multiple languages with rich and natural facial expressions.**

**üßç PSHuman single-image 3D human body reconstruction technology preserves personal identity and clothing details, though facial reconstruction needs improvement.**

**üé¨ ComfyUI-LTXTricks open-source ComfyUI nodes enhance LTX video model control capabilities, supporting image-to-video conversion, style transfer, and other functions with impressive results.**



### Cutting-edge Technology

**1. An innovative high-fidelity 3D avatar animation generation technology: GaussianSpeech.**

Simply by inputting a voice clip, it can generate high-fidelity, 3D-consistent human head animations with rich facial expressions and details, including lip movements, wrinkles, and eye highlights.

Detailed introduction: https://shivangi-aneja.github.io/projects/gaussianspeech/

The character performance is natural and realistic, including lip-sync, facial changes, and even singing capabilities, supporting multiple languages (Chinese, English, Spanish, etc.).

Looks very realistic; the code hasn't been released yet, interested parties can keep an eye out.

**2. A 3D human body model reconstruction technology: PSHuman.**

Using just a single image of a person, it can reconstruct a highly realistic 3D model that preserves identity characteristics.

Detailed introduction: https://penghtyx.github.io/PSHuman/

The results look average, with some facial deformation, but clothing preservation is quite good.

### Open Source Projects

**1. A set of ComfyUI nodes for enhancing LTX video model control capabilities: ComfyUI-LTXTricks.**

Primarily provides additional control options for LTX video models, including image-to-video conversion, video style transfer, and video local editing enhancement features.
