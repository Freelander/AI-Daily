This allows users to quickly edit images through simple text descriptions, while also supporting localized control of certain features, such as changing a person's hair, without altering the overall image.

Detailed introduction: https://betterze.github.io/TurboEdit/

Currently, it is only at the research paper stage, and the code is not yet open-source. From the demonstration videos, it appears to accurately modify specified attributes of objects, and the generation speed is very fast.
