**1. Another AI programming model claiming to be the world's strongest: Genie.**

It achieved an industry-leading score of 30.08% in the SWE-Bench evaluation and 50.67% in SWE-Lite.

It demonstrated its powerful problem-solving capabilities in software engineering and can perform logical reasoning like human development engineers.

### Open Source Projects

**1. The world's first automated scientific research AI system "AI Scientist" is officially open-sourced!**

It has achieved the entire process from conceptualization, code writing, conducting experiments, summarizing results, to writing complete papers and peer reviewing.

Paper: [arxiv.org/abs/2408.06292](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06292)
GitHub: [github.com/SakanaAI/AI-Scientist](http://github.com/SakanaAI/AI-Scientist)

Moreover, it supports the use of multiple mainstream large language models, such as Claude, ChatGPT, etc.

The project is now open-source, and it also provides 10 papers generated by this system for everyone to evaluate the quality of the generation.

Those interested can take a look.

**2. An open-source plugin that can convert ComfyUI workflows into mini-programs: ComfyUI_Bxb.**

By installing this plugin, you can achieve one-click conversion of your existing workflows into mini-programs for current mainstream platforms, and support monetization through payments.

GitHub: https://github.com/zhulu111/ComfyUI_Bxb

If you already have a monetizable ComfyUI workflow, you might want to try this plugin to convert the workflow into a mini-program for further promotion.
