### AI Drawing

**1. IC-Light V2 Flux version released by author Min.**

Based on Flux's IC-Light model, it can automatically perform image matting, generate accurate backgrounds, automatically match light and shadow synthesis to generate new images.

GitHub: https://github.com/lllyasviel/IC-Light/discussions/98

It features 16ch VAE and native high resolution, greatly preserving original image details.

### Frontier Technology

**1. Microsoft open-sourced a pure vision-based GUI agent: OmniParser.**

It can accurately recognize interactive icons on interfaces and understand the semantics of elements in screenshots to enable more automated interface interaction scenarios, such as automated testing and operations.

GitHub: https://github.com/microsoft/OmniParser

Detailed introduction: https://microsoft.github.io/OmniParser/

Primarily through its powerful screen parsing technology, it converts user interfaces into structured elements, thereby improving the visual recognition capabilities of multimodal models like GPT-4V.

Supports seamless integration with different vision-language models, such as Phi-3.5-V, Llama-3.2-V, and GPT-4V.

### Open Source Projects

1. I've recommended many GitHub projects, but often hear about slow access and image loading issues.

If you're experiencing these issues, you must try the GitHub520 project. No program installation required, just 5 minutes to solve broken images and slow loading problems.

GitHub: https://github.com/521xueweihan/GitHub520

It primarily works by modifying Hosts through the SwitchHosts tool and provides the latest available hosts file.

**2. A powerful command-line fuzzy finder: fzf.**

Quickly filter desired commands from any list using fuzzy matching algorithms, including files, command history, processes, hostnames, bookmarks, and Git commits.

GitHub: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf

Supports multiple display modes, provides rich customization options, and integrates with bash, zsh, fish, Vim, and Neovim.
