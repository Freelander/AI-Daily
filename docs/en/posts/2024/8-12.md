**2. A video fusion hand-drawn doodle technique released by Adobe: Video Doodles.**

### Open Source Projects

**1. Another AI open-source video editing tool: Clapper.**

It can generate images, videos, voices, music, and various materials needed for video editing with one click, and then perform secondary editing.

It allows you to create videos with AI in an interactive, iterative, and intuitive way, without the need for other external tools or video editing skills.
