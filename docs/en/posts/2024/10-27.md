### Cutting-edge Technology

**1. OpenAI shares new AI text-to-image solution: sCM, 50 times faster than traditional diffusion models.**

Compared to traditional diffusion models, sCM only needs two sampling steps to generate high-quality images, claiming to improve text-to-image efficiency by approximately 50 times, with generation quality comparable to current strong diffusion models.

**2. Meta open-sources a multimodal language model for long video generation: LongVU.**

Through cross-modal queries and inter-frame dependencies, it achieves adaptive temporal and spatial compression of long videos, effectively reducing video token count while preserving visual details.
