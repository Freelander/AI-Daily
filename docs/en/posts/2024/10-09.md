### Cutting-edge Technology

**1. Interesting, a multimodal model unifying text, music, and motion generation: UniMuMo.**

Capable of generating music with accompanying dance movements based on text, accepting text, music, and motion data as input conditions to produce output spanning these three modalities.

Detailed introduction: https://hanyangclarence.github.io/unimumo_demo/

GitHub: https://github.com/hanyangclarence/UniMuMo

In simple terms, it can understand text, interpret music, and choreograph dances. It can generate actions based on text + music, or generate music based on text + actions, etc.
