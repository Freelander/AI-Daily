### Cutting-edge News

**1. "EVE" - The first 3D AI companion.**

I saw a video on Bilibili and was amazed. It claims to be the first 3D AI companion, and from the promotional video, the effect looks super good.

Whether it's the character modeling, actions, or even voice, I personally think it's perfectly presented, and it also has multimodal capabilities.

### Cutting-edge Technology

**1. OpenAI open-sources a framework for building, orchestrating, and deploying multi-agent collaboration: Swarm.**

Mainly used for coordination between multiple agents, assigning tasks to suitable agents based on requirements, supporting function calls, context variables, etc., and capable of returning strings, agents, or Result objects.

It looks a bit similar to Dify or Coze, except that OpenAI is currently pure code, and the next step might be to provide visual orchestration.
