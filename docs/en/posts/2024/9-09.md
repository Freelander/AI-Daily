**1. A report on GitHub Copilot's impact on programmer productivity.**

A series of randomized controlled trials were conducted on 4,800+ programmers from Microsoft, Accenture, and a Fortune 100 company, randomly assigning them GitHub Copilot.

Results:

Developers using AI tools completed 26.08% more tasks, with a significant improvement for junior programmers.

Report: [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4945566&utm_source=substack](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4945566&utm_source=substack)

Regardless of whether the results are completely objective, from a real programmer's perspective, tools like GitHub Copilot and Cursor can indeed improve development efficiency to some extent.

It is recommended that all developers try these two AI tools.
