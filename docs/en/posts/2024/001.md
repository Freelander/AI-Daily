# Issue 001 -- AI Content Pollution in Search

![](https://oss.justin3go.com/blogs/fav0-001.jpg)

On Saturdays/weekends, I usually go out to play badminton. After playing, I sometimes have dinner with friends. The photo above is from one of those dinners - Wushan Paper-Wrapped Fish ðŸ˜‹. Unfortunately, I injured my foot playing badminton on Friday, so I'll be resting this weekend.

## \>\> Topics to Discuss

Recently, a [hot topic](https://x.com/oran_ge/status/1795763307309363396) has emerged: discovering AI-generated content cited within AI search engines.

![](https://oss.justin3go.com/blogs/Pasted%20image%2020240601140423.png)

What problem does this cause? Simply put, it leads to "misinformation propagation and hallucination overlap."

Imagine this: AI-generated answers still have hallucinations. The emergence of RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) aims to avoid these hallucinations by referencing correct sources. However, if RAG references AI-generated content and then the AI reinterprets it, the hallucination becomes even more severe, making the content unusable and hard to trust.

Moreover, some users have discovered that searching `site:doubao.com` on Google yields over tens of millions of results!

Of course, it seems that Doubao has since made corrections, and the excessive SEO optimizations have been taken down.

However, I believe this is something that search engines like Google should handle. Here are some of my questions:

1. Did Google not notice this? Can't they customize a strategy?
2. Is it that they can't distinguish AI content and don't know what to do?
3. Or is the AI-generated content still valuable? For example, users can directly search for corresponding AI answers without consuming tokens and phrasing questions.

Even if Doubao has corrected it, what about other AI sites, especially those personal AI content sites? There are many examples of people doing anything for traffic. When I use a search engine, I naturally want to find content I need. How to filter and whether it can be filtered should be the job of the search engine.

Just like how many sites used to stuff unrelated keywords to increase search hits and were then eliminated by PageRank, which contributed to Google's success.

Furthermore, if you create a search engine now that can use some strategy to distinguish AI content, wouldn't it attract many dissatisfied users? After all, some people will always prefer non-AI-written content, given that AI content still has hallucinations.

### [GPT-4-turbo vs GPT-4o](https://community.openai.com/t/gpt-4-vs-gpt-4o-which-is-the-better/746991/9)

If I only use text and don't focus on multimodal, which one performs better? There is a discussion on the official forum, and several top-rated answers suggest that GPT-4-turbo seems to perform better.

> that GPT-4-turbo is a lot better than GPT-4o.

> GPT 4 turbo is much better for step by step tasks.

Here is also a [detailed blog](https://www.vellum.ai/blog/analysis-gpt-4o-vs-gpt-4-turbo) comparing their performances:

- Data Extraction: GPT-4o shows better performance than GPT-4 Turbo but still lacks accuracy in complex tasks.
- Classification: GPT-4o has the highest precision, making it the best choice to avoid false positives. GPT-4 Turbo shows lower accuracy.
- Conversational Reasoning: GPT-4o has made significant improvements in some reasoning tasks but still needs improvement. GPT-4 Turbo finds these tasks more challenging.
- Latency: GPT-4o has lower latency, responding faster than GPT-4 Turbo.
- Throughput: GPT-4o has a throughput of 109 tokens per second compared to GPT-4 Turbo's 20 tokens per second.

While GPT-4o is the clear winner in quality and latency, it may not be the best model for every task.

This article studies how, when we program, the part of the brain activated is not the area for language processing but the multiple demand network related to mathematics. However, it does not precisely replicate the cognitive demands of mathematics.

Language is just a tool. Once we learn how to express it, we focus more on the logic behind the language.
