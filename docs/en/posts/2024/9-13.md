### Cutting-edge News

**1. Finally here, OpenAI releases a new model o1 with thinking capabilities!**

The model takes more time to think before answering, and its reasoning ability is very strong, also performing well in math and programming.

However, note that o1 is currently in preview mode and focuses on reasoning; it lacks multimodal capabilities and needs to be used alongside GPT-4o.

Detailed introduction: [https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/](https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/)

Currently, Plus and Team users can use the o1-preview and o1-mini models on the official website. The o1-mini responds faster but with slightly reduced quality.

Additionally, both models have a limited number of message uses: o1-preview allows 30 messages per week, while o1-mini allows 50 messages per week.

**2. Suno AI introduces the Covers feature.**

It can transform any audio, from simple voice recordings to full songs, into a new style while retaining the unique original melody.

You can:

ü¶ã Transform uploaded audio: Try uploading a snippet of your singing, humming, or instrumental playing, and create a Cover.

üé§ Convert instrumental to vocal: Add lyrics to an instrumental track to create a rich musical piece.

How to create a Cover:

1. Find your song in the music library or creation page.
2. Click the three dots, select "Create," then choose "Cover Song."
3. Enter or select a new musical style, and your original lyrics will be automatically infused into the new style.

Note: For best results, it is recommended to keep the lyrics unchanged initially, but feel free to experiment and adjust as needed.
