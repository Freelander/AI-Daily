**2. Replit has released a powerful AI programming tool called Replit Agent.**

Although tools like Cursor and GitHub Copilot are powerful AI-assisted development tools, beginners with no programming background still find it difficult to develop and deploy applications from scratch.

Apart from writing code, it involves complex steps like environment setup, database configuration, and deployment.

With Replit Agent, all these processes can now be automated.

You just need to describe your requirements, and the Agent will create a plan and complete the development process. In the end, just a few clicks are needed to launch the application.

Moreover, Replit also provides a mobile app, allowing you to activate the Agent anytime, submit your requirements, and directly develop and deploy without needing a computer.

Additionally, the generated code is visible, so users with programming skills can modify it themselves.

Currently, Replit Agent is available only to paid users. If you're interested, you can watch the detailed introduction video before deciding whether to subscribe.
