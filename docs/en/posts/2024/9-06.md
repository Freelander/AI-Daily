**2. Replit has released a powerful AI programming tool called Replit Agent.**

Despite the existence of powerful AI development assistance tools like Cursor and GitHub Copilot, it is still difficult for complete beginners to develop and launch applications from scratch.

Besides writing code, there are complex steps involved, such as environment setup, database configuration, and deployment.

Now, with Replit Agent, all of these processes can be automated.

You simply describe the requirements, and the Agent will create a plan and progressively complete the development. Finally, with just a few clicks, the application can be deployed online.

Moreover, Replit even offers a mobile app that allows you to activate the Agent anytime, submit requirements, and directly develop and deploy, all without the need for a computer.

Additionally, the generated code is visible, so users with programming knowledge can make their own modifications.

Currently, Replit Agent is available only to paid users. If you are interested, you can first watch the detailed introduction video and then decide whether to open it for a trial.
