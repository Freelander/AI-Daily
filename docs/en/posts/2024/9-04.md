### Cutting-edge News

**1. Luma AI adds camera control features for video generation.**

Users can input "Camera" to trigger and select different types of camera movement, such as moving left/right, zooming in/out, panning, circling, and vertical movement.

Try it out online: [https://lumalabs.ai/dream-machine](https://lumalabs.ai/dream-machine)

The demo looks great. Now there’s another exciting way to generate videos.

**2. Baidu’s Wenxin Yiyan renamed to "Wen Xiaoyan".**

They also announced that the Wenxin 4.0 large model will be free to use in September.

I can’t even remember when I last used it. Is anyone still using it?

### AI Artwork

**1. LivePortrait, the open-source portrait animation framework from Kuaishou, now has a ComfyUI plugin!**

It can animate facial expressions in a static portrait, supporting various styles of images while maintaining character consistency. The facial expression control is excellent.

More details on LivePortrait: [https://liveportrait.github.io/](https://liveportrait.github.io/)

I found today that there’s a ComfyUI plugin for it on GitHub: ComfyUI-AdvancedLivePortrait.

It’s faster and offers real-time preview. You can directly edit facial expressions in images and insert them into videos. I believe this will make for some fun video creations.

GitHub: [https://github.com/PowerHouseMan/ComfyUI-AdvancedLivePortrait](https://github.com/PowerHouseMan/ComfyUI-AdvancedLivePortrait)

Now available for installation via ComfyUI-Manager. Give it a try if you’re interested.

### Open-source Projects

**1. An open-source AI code editor designed for 10x engineers: Melty.**

It integrates with the entire development workflow, understanding everything from your terminal to GitHub operations, helping you write and refactor code more efficiently. It can also perform large-scale changes across multiple files.

GitHub: [https://github.com/meltylabs/melty](https://github.com/meltylabs/melty)

Its main goals are:

- Helping developers better understand and maintain code.
- Observing every change you make like a pair programmer.
- Learning and adapting to your codebase.
- Integrating with compilers, terminals, debuggers, as well as tools like Linear and GitHub.

Quick tip: 10x engineers are those who are 10 times more efficient than others.
