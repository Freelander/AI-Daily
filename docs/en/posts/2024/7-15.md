### Open-source Projects

**1. An open-source terminal AI assistant AI Shell on GitHub.**

On the terminal command line interface (CLI), it can convert natural language into corresponding executable Shell commands, similar to GitHub Copilot X CLI.

For example, if you want to execute a certain long command on the terminal but can't remember it, you can use this tool to provide the command, confirm it, and then execute it.

GitHub: https://github.com/BuilderIO/ai-shell

The tool supports multiple languages, including Chinese, English, and Japanese. Interested users can install and try it out.
