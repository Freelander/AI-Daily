### Open-source Projects

**1. Anthropic officially open-sourced a quick guide for building Claude applications: Anthropic Quickstarts.**

It aims to help developers quickly build deployable applications based on the Anthropic API, and to create a knowledge base for RAG by integrating with Amazon Bedrock.

Currently, it mainly shares the entire process of receiving payments on overseas websites, including registering an overseas company, applying for an EIN, applying for a U.S. bank account, activating Stripe, etc.
